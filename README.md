# Secflow
Secflow is an innovative product designed by cybersecurity experts. It automates the detection and remediation of your vulnerabilities to finally be faster and more efficient than cybercriminal organizations.

It is built around 4 main principles:
  - Thanks to Artificial Intelligence coupled with our expertise, Secflow automates continuous penetration tests. This allows us to identify your assets (known and  shadow-it) and vulnerabilities in real time over a wide area.
  - At a glance, visualize your overall level of security and especially how to improve it.
  - Real adapted solutions appear on the Dashboard. You will be able to act yourself or quickly transmit the solution directly to the teams concerned and follow the remediation.
  - Then Secflow lets you make sure everything has been fixed with one click, by retesting.

This solution is simple, easy to learn and makes cybersecurity accessible to everyone. Our watchword: **demotivate cybercriminals**
